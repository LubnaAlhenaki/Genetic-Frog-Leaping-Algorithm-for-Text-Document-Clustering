# Genetic-Frog-Leaping-Algorithm-for-Text-Document-Clustering
In this study, we developed a text document clustering optimization model using a novel genetic frog-leaping algorithm that efficiently clusters text documents based on selected features. The proposed approach is based on two metaheuristic algorithms: a genetic algorithm (GA) and a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA). The GA performs feature selection, and the SFLA performs clustering.
